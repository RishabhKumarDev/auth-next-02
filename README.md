# Next.js + NextAuth Practice Project

This is a practice project to learn **Next.js**, **NextAuth.js** authentication, and **TypeScript** with **Tailwind CSS**.  
The focus of this project is on understanding the authentication flow and backend logic rather than UI/UX design, so the UI is basic and unstyled.
